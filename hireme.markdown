title: Hire Me
---

~~If you have a project in Haskell you can hire me as a software
engineer.
~~

**Update (2023-01-16)** I currently work for
[Scrive](https://www.scrive.com).

Apart from a PhD in Mathematics, I have 4 years experience as a
professional software developer. I like to work in Haskell and
PureScript. I am interested in learning other strongly typed
functional languages.

I know some DevOps driven by [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and
[Nix](https://nixos.org).

I have been working on a backend for the [PureScript
compiler](/posts/2022-06-27-pureshell-first-look.html) targeting
Bash. I think this will be eminently useful, on the other hand this
has been a test bed to try out dependently typed Haskell.

Get [in touch](/contact.html).
