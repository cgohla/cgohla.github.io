title: "Highlight: The Categorical Origins of Lebesgue Integration"
---
   
I want to discuss a recent pre-print by Tom Leinster, namely [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00412][The
categorical origins of Lebesgue integration]].

It is a very nice exposition of some very important gadgets in
functional analysis, namely the vector spaces $L^p([0,1])$ and
$\ell^p$. The part that really caught interest is that the
aforementioned spaces are initial $F$-algebras in normed vector
spaces.

Let me explain why this is nice: \(F\)-algebras are a very basic
concept from categorical algebra: if $F$ is a functor $F: C→C$,
then an $F$-algebra on an object $X$ is a $C$-morphism $\xi:
FX→X$. A morphism $f: X → Y $ is an $F$-algebra morphism if
$\upsilon\circ Ff = f \circ \xi$.

A simple example over sets would be the functor $X \mapsto 1+X$. In
this case an algebra on a set $X$ is a pair of functions $1→X$ and
$X→X$. It's easy to see that the natural numbers $N$ are such an
algebra, where the first function picks the number 0, and the
second is the successor function. 

What makes the natural numbers special among all algebras of this
kind is that for any other such algebra $\alpha: 1+A→A$ there is a
unique function $f:N→A$, which is an algebra homomorphism.  This is
essentially a restatement of the Peano axioms.

Categorically we say that $1+N→N$ is initial in the category of
$(1+\_)$-algebras.

Now let us turn our attention to the category $\mathrm{Ban}$ of
Banach spaces and contractive maps, i.e., linear maps of norm at
most 1. Let's say the ground field is $\mathbb{R}$

The field $\mathbb{R}$ itself is of course a Banach space in a
natural way, so it is an object in $\mathrm{Ban}$. A morphism $R→V$
to another Banach space corresponds to a choice of vector $v$ in
$V$ of norm at most 1. In particular, such Banach spaces with a
choice of vector of norm less than 1 form a category
$\mathbb{R}/\mathrm{Ban}$ where the morphisms are linear
contractions taking chosen vector to chosen vector. This cateogry
has an initial object, namely $\mathbb{R}$ with chosen element 1,
meaning there is a unique linear contraction $(\mathbb{R},1)→(V,v)$
for every $(V,v)$.

We are now going to define an endo-functor $F_p$ on $\mathrm{Ban}$
and extend it to $\mathbb{R}/\mathrm{Ban}$ where $p\geq 1$ is a
real number: $F_p$ takes the vector space $V$ to the direct sum
$V\oplus V$ with the norm given by the $p$-average $$|v+v'| =
\left(\frac{1}{2}(|v|^p+|v'|^p)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}$$. 

To extend $F_p$ to $\mathb{R}/\mathrm{Ban}$ we observe that if our
chosen vector in $V$ is $v$ then in $V\oplus V$ we can choose
$v+v$, and its norm will be exactly $|v|$ with the norm taken in
$V$. If the vector space in question was $\mathbb{R}$, then $F_p$
of it is $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the (appropiately scaled)
$p$-norm. Because $(\mathbb{R},1)$ is initial in our category, The
diagonal $\mathbb{R}→\mathbb{R}^2$ is the uniquely determined
contractive linear map. 

If we keep iterating $F_p$ we get
$F_^n(\mathbb{R},1)=(\mathbb{R}^{2^n},e)$ where $e$ is all 1s and
the norm is the $p$-average over all the entries in a vector. For
convenince let's $E_n=F_^n(\mathbb{R},1)$. We get norm preserving
linear maps $E_n→E_{n+1}$ that duplicate every entry in a row
vector.

We obtain a diagram
$$
\begin{CD}
E_0 @> E_1 @> E_2 
\end{CD}
$$

It turns out that if we are in the category of Banach spaces, we
can define
